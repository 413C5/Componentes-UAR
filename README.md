# UAR Components

This program allows users to search through several UAR components. Users can display the description of a selected component and search for occurrences of a keyword or phrase within the presented description. The program then displays the number of occurrences of that keyword or phrase, along with the position of the first and last occurrence.

The design of the interface prioritized the application of design heuristics to ensure ease of use, alongside adherence to recommended coding practices.
